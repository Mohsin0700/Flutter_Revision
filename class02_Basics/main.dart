void main(){
  // In first class sir Bilal Rehman gave a detailed introductury session of dart and flutter and successfully deleivered knowledge of this course roadmap. Thanks sir Bilal for creating this course.

  // Second class
  // this class starts from very basic function called main and it's return type which is "void keyword"
  // There are a lot of return types and void is one of them
  // void keyword is used when a function returns nothing

  print("Mohsin Hussain");
  // Above statement print my name on terminal
  // As we are currently working on dart language which is not capable to create ui(user-interface) so, we can only do programming work and can see the result on terminal(cmd,powershell etc)...
  // print is a built-in keyword for dart programming lanaguage which is used to print anything(any data-type on terminal)
  // print is written and followed by opening and closing curly braces
  // I wrote my name in double qoutes because if I write my name without qoutes dart / compiler will think it as of dart built-in keyword which will give a compiler error.
  // The text written in double qoutes is called string in programming which we will se in our next classes.
  // Finally we had closed the syntax by a semi-colon which is mendatory except in some cases which will be discovered later.
  // we can also print some numbers using print keyword, let's try to do an example by printing my date and month of birth...
  print(30);
  print(07);
